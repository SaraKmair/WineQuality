# WineQuality
This case study is a multi-class classification

This analysis aims toÂ :
Understand how different features affect wine quality,
Predict the quality of wine

Meta Data:
-Fixed.acidity: a measurement of the total concentration of titratable acids. <br />
-Volatile.acidity: a measure of steam distillable acids. <br />
-Citric.acid: one of the many acids that are measured to obtained fixed acidity <br />
-Residual.sugar: measurement of any natural grape sugars that are leftover after fermentation ceases. <br />
-Chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine.<br />
-Free.sulfur.dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion.<br />
-Total.sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of SO2; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.<br />
-Density: measure of density of wine.<br />
-pH: value for pH.<br />
-Sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.<br />
-Alcohol: the percentage of alcohol present in the wine<br />
-Quality: subjective measurement ranging from 1 to 10 (although the observed data ranges from 3 to 8).<br />
